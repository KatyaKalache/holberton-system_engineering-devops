# Web stack debugging #3
![alt text](http://i.imgur.com/d42WuBh.png)
## Description
When debugging, sometimes logs are not enough. Either because the software is breaking in a way that was not expected and is the error is not being logged, or because logs are not providing enough information. In this case, you will need to go down the stack, the good news is that this is something Holberton students can do :)
## Tasks:
0. Using strace, find out why Apache is returning a 500 error. Once you find the issue, fix it and then automate it using Puppet (instead of using Bash as you were previously doing).
