## Description
We love to say that sky is the limit but sometimes you actually want to restrict a bit. Linux is pretty good at this.
## Tasks:
0. In this web stack debugging task, we are testing how well our web server setup featuring Nginx is doing under pressure and it turns out itâ€™s not doing well: we are getting a huge amount of failed requests.
1. Change the OS configuration so that it is possible to login with the `holberton` user and open a file without any error message.
